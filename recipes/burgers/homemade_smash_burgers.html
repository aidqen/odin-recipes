    <p><h4 id="introduction">This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.</h4><br>
        Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best<br> results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these<br>
        outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast<br> because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<li>4 hamburger buns</li><br>
<li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li><br>
<li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li><br>
<li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li><br>
<li>salt to taste</li><br>
<li>4 slices American cheese</li><br>
<li>burger toppings of choice</li><br>
     </ul>

     <ol>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron<br>
         flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>

         <li><h3>Step 2</h3>
            Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>

<li><h3>Step 3</h3>
    Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as<br>
    this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover<br>
    with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square<br>
    on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy<br>
    spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom<br>
    of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>

    <li><h3>Step 4</h3>
    Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are<br>
    a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the<br>
    patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional<br>
    15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have<br>
    4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
